    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to support the school choir attendance management system with a focus on generating printable reports. Key considerations include: \n\n*   **Authorization Independence:** Each collection is designed to be accessed independently, avoiding `get()` calls in security rules.  Specifically, denormalization isn't needed for `students` and `choir_members` because access is managed on upload and membership. For attendance, access control will depend on the rules you implement on the UI; there is no owner or shared access scenario.\n*   **QAPs (Queryability and Performance):**  The segregation of data into distinct collections (`students`, `choir_members`, `choir_attendance`) simplifies queries and improves performance. The structure facilitates efficient `list` operations for attendance reports based on date ranges, classes, or terms.\n*   **Scalability:** The structure allows for efficient querying and report generation even with a large number of students and attendance records.\n*   **Report Generation:** The structure optimizes querying for report generation, allowing for easy retrieval of necessary data.\n\nTo enhance the design further, consider the following:\n\n*   **Indexes:** Define composite indexes for common queries, especially those used for report generation (e.g., queries based on date ranges and classes in `choir_attendance`).\n*   **Data Validation:** Implement client-side and server-side data validation to ensure data integrity, especially for mandatory fields.\n*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for file uploads and data processing to prevent data loss and ensure system stability.\n*   **Security Rules:**  Implement comprehensive security rules to protect data and ensure that only authorized users can access and modify data.\n\n"
